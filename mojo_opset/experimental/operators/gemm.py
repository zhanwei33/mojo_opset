        Quantized batch GEMM with per-token scaling and batch reduction.

        Applies batched GEMM on int8 inputs/weights in float32, scales by
        per-token `x1_scale` and per-output `x2_scale`, then reduces over batch.

        Args:
            input (torch.Tensor): 3D tensor of shape (B, M, K).
            x1_scale (torch.Tensor): Per-token scale of shape (B, M).
            x2_scale (torch.Tensor): Per-output scale of shape (N,), bfloat16 preferred.

        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: Reduced output of shape (M, N) in bfloat16.

        Notes:
            - Expects `self.weight` of shape (B, K, N) if `trans_weight` is False,
              otherwise (B, N, K) and transposed to (B, K, N).
            - The reduction sums outputs across batch dimension B.
            - This operator is experimental because its algorithmic contract is still under review.
